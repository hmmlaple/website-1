# Gitpod Local Companion

> **Please note:** The Gitpod Local Companion is currently in beta. If you experience any issues, or have feedback, please [get in touch](https://www.gitpod.io/support).

You can refer to the [Gitpod Local Companion - localhost is going remote](/blog/local-app) blog post for details on how to explore the beta release of the _Gitpod local companion_.

## Connect To VS Code Desktop

Whilst it is possible to use the Gitpod local companion to connect your desktop VS Code application to Gitpod, the best way is to use the Gitpod VSCode Plugin, which you can access directly from the command pallette via any Gitpod the workspace. For more details about VS Code Desktop, please refer to the [VS Code desktop support docs](/docs/ides-and-editors/vscode).

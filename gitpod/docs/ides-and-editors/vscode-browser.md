## Changing the VS Code Browser version

VS Code Browser in Gitpod is based on a fork of [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) called [OpenVSCode Server
](https://github.com/gitpod-io/openvscode-server). VS Code in the browser in Gitpod is updated frequently, to use the latest nightly build of Gitpod you can switch to the "insiders" version of VS Code from [your Gitpod preferences page](https://gitpod.io/preferences).
